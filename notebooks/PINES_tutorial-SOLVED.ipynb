    "# Introduction\n",
    "Permutationally Invariant Network for Enhanced Sampling (PINES) is a data-driven method for automatically discovering high variance collective variables (CVs) and enhanced sampling to obtain free energy landscapes of single and multi-component molecular systems. It can be conceived as a permutationally invariant extension to the Molecular Enhanced Sampling with Autoencoders (MESA) method. PINES comprises four main components (Fig. 1):\n",

    "2. Permutation Invariant Vector (PIV) featurization (F):  Translationally, rotationally, and permutationally invariant representation of the molecular system.\n",

    "In this introductory tutorial, we apply PINES to study a NaCl ion pair's association or dissociation process in water. This is a classic system, where it is well known that the rearrangement of water molecules in the solvation shell of ions plays a critical role in driving the association or dissociation of NaCl. In other words, enhanced sampling of association or dissociation of Na+ and Cl- ions in water may require explicit biasing along water degrees of freedom. This tutorial shows how the permutational invariance built into PINES helps us discover solvent-inclusive high-variance CVs. Representing solvent-inclusive CVs is challenging using traditional molecular representational techniques because water molecules are indistinguishable; therefore, their identity should not be embedded in the system's manifold or the CVs. PINES offers a computationally efficient solution to this problem using PIV representation that automatically removes translational, rotational, and permutational variances while retaining the same information as the Cartesian coordinates up to rigid transformations, according to the rigid graph theorem. Below, we walk through each step of applying PINES to iteratively discover high-variance CVs and perform enhanced sampling MD simulations along these CVs to study the free energy landscape of NaCl association or dissociation in water. This notebook goes through only the first iteration of appying PINES, starting with an unbiased trajectory to outline the overall pipeline of applying PINES. For subsequent iteration, one only needs to change the input data to the autoencoder training step from the PIVs calculated for the unbiased trajectory to the PIVs calculated for the last iteration's biased trajectory, and follow the same steps.\n"

We provide all the necessary files in GROMACS format for running the simulations in this tutorial. We then collect the seed trajectory of length 50 ns in an NVT ensemble.

    "1. <ins>Distance matrix</ins> ($a_{ij}$): We first construct a distance matrix populated with the Euclidean pairwise distances between atoms in the system. The distance matrix is then ordered into a block structure where each “block” contains the pairwise distances of a pair of atom types. Here, atom types refer to all atoms that share a chemical identity, following the conventional terminology of force fields. For example, for our system with O, H, Na, and Cl atoms, the distance matrix can have up to 10 blocks: O-O, O-H, O-Cl, Na-O, H-H, Cl-H, Na-H, Na-Na, Na-Cl, Cl-Cl. Each block contains the distances $a_{ij}$ corresponding to the atom-type pairs. Because our goal is to study the Na-Cl ion pair association or disassociation, we will only focus on the blocks involving the ion, i.e., Na-Cl, Na-O, Na-H, Cl-O, and Cl-H.\n",

The switching function scales the distances to the (0, 1) interval, where values closer to 1 indicate atoms nearby and 0 indicates atom pairs that are far away. The switching range can be controlled through the switching function parameters $n$, $m$, $r^{\\text{block}}_0$, and $d_0$. These parameters can be appropriately selected using the radial distribution function (RDF) between the atoms corresponding to a given block in the distance matrix. In brief, we estimate the RDF profiles from the seed simulation. We set $r^{\\text{block}}_0$ to be the mean of the first and second peaks of the solvation shell from the RDF. $n$ is tuned so that $v_{ij}$ for the pairwise distance at the first peak is close to 0.9, and the $v_{ij}$ value for the pairwise distance at the second peak is close to 0.1. For our system, $d_0$ is set to 0 and $m=2n$. Please see the PINES paper for more details on selecting and the significance of tuning these parameters.\n",

Other supported value is `ONLYDIRECT`, which considers identical atom type pairs for constructing PIV. `ONLYDIRECT` is suitable for Argon system containing identical particles and is tested only with that system.\n",
    "\n",
    "`REF_FILE`: Input reference PDB file. It should contain the same order of atoms with same indices as the structure file used for performing the simulations. Atom names in PDB could be modified as needed to define the `ATOMTYPES` values set below for constructing the PIV.\n",

    "`PINESATOMS`: Total number of atom types. This is the same as the length of `ATOMTYPES` and is used for detecting errors in ATOMTYPES declaration.\n",

    "`SFACTOR`: Scaling factor for the PIV values (not implemented in the current version of PINES). Should be the same size as of number of blocks = (`PINESATOMS`-3)x(`PINESATOMS`-3)x0.5 + (`PINESATOMS`-3) + (`PINESATOMS`-3).\n",
    "\n",
    "`SORT`: Whether to sort each block of the PIV or not. Should be the same size as of number of blocks.\n",
    "\n",
    "`SWITCH*`: Parameters of the switching functions for each block. There should be one `SWITCH*` command per block. Parameters of the switching function are specified as `{func_type R_0=X MM=X NN=X}`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`NL_CUTOFF`: Neighbor list cutoff for each element in PIV. Same size as nelements. Use a small value but update the neighbor list frequently, which can be expensive. Alternatively, use a high value and update less frequently to save computational time.\n",

    "\n",
    "PINES employs autoencoders to determine the low-dimensional embedding of the system spanned by a small number of high-variance CVs. In brief, the autoencoders aim to approximately find a nonlinear mapping between a high-dimensional input and a low-dimensional output. A maximum mean discrepancy Wasserstein autoencoder (MMD-WAE) is applied to learn the nonlinear mapping between the high-dimensional PIV input and the low-dimensional high-variance CVs in PINES. The MMD-WAE architecture, following other autoencoders, consists of an encoder block and a decoder block connected through a bottleneck layer that compresses the information flow from the input. The goal of the decoder is to reconstruct the input data given the compressed representation from the bottleneck layer. This process allows the autoencoder to learn a low-dimensional distribution of the input data effectively. In this notebook, you will find an example of the PyTorch model that can be used to train the MMD-WAE for the NaCl system. PINES then applies principal component analysis (PCA) to the learned hidden variables to find linear combinations with maximum variance. The permutational invariance is built into the discovered hidden variable because the autoencoder is learning to reconstruct the input PIVs, which are permutationally invariant."

      "/tmp/jobs/43127271/ipykernel_46462/4137612866.py:1: FutureWarning: You are using `torch.load` with `weights_only=False` (the current default value), which uses the default pickle module implicitly. It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file. Please open an issue on GitHub for any issues related to this experimental feature.\n",
